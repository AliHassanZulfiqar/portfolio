  <h2>A little Bit About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a highly motivated student developer seeking a role as a developer in a reputable organization to utilize my skills and gain more valuable experience. I am also working as a Network Engineer in XpertDigi</p>

  <h2>My Journey So Far</h2>
  <p>I began my bachelor's degree in software engineering in 2020, but I had to find employment to support my family because of financial difficulties. In February 2021, I was hired as an intern network engineer at United Computer Solutions. I didn't begin as a developer because, at the time, I lacked any experience. I departed the company in August 2021, and in September of the same year, I received an offer to work for XpertDigi, a sister company.</p>
  <p>My father passed suddenly in September 2022, leaving me as the one who had to support my family. In June 2023, I started my degree again and enrolled in online courses to help me break into the programming industry.</p>
